        <p>This third-person adventure game marked my first foray into Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint scripting, It was an assigned project during the first year of my university course. During the development process, I experimented with rigid body dynamics, applying forces to objects, and creating various interactive Blueprint actors. The project consists of five levels, four of which feature the player controlling a robot from a third-person perspective.</p>

                <span>Actor Interaction:</span>
                <p>Through my work with Blueprints, I learned how to reference and cast actors effectively. I then developed a simple dialogue system that manages both inputs and text parameters.<br><br>A key focus of this project was actor interaction. The player can perform various actions, including picking up keys, activating switches, opening locked doors, interacting with NPCs, and colliding with hazards, among other functionalities.</p>

                <span>Finite State Machine:</span>
                <p>I developed a sentry enemy that utilizes a finite state machine system with three distinct states: idle, off, and locked on. In the idle state, the sentry scans the area for the player. Upon detecting the player, it transitions to the locked-on state, where it tracks the player and fires until they are out of range. Additionally, this enemy can be disabled by interacting with another actor in the room, causing it to power down and cease all actions.</p>

                <p>While learning the basics, I experimented with movement and physics systems in Unreal Engine using cubes. Additionally, I became familiar with the material and material instance systems by assigning each cube a unique identifier.</p>
