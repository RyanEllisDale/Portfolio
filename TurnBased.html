        <p>Building on my experience from the third-person project, this university assignment allowed me to deepen my skills in several key areas. I learned how to take control of the main camera actor, create collectibles along with a pseudo-inventory system, and establish a turn order for defined actors—each of which is a child of the "TurnActor." Additionally, I gained experience in managing dynamic materials within the project.</p>

                <span>Turn Order:</span>
                <p>I developed a turn order manager system that determines when actors are allowed to execute their update and step events. Each actor is assigned an index within this manager, and after an actor completes its turn, the index advances to the next actor. This process continues in a loop, returning to the first actor once all have had their turn.<br><br>The turn order manager specifically targets the TurnActor Blueprint Class and all its children, allowing for any object to be made a child of this class to participate in the turn system. Using this logic, I was able to design moving walls, cover, and interactable obstacles that take their turn only when activated.</p>

                <span>Camera:</span>
                <p>Given the prototype's top-down perspective and the fact that all turn actors receive a turn regardless of their position in the scene, I deemed it needed to create a versatile camera system for the prototype.<br><br>The camera can switch between being locked to a target and manual control using the Tab key. Additionally, it can be instantly positioned to follow the next actor in the turn order by pressing the Alt key. The camera also supports zooming in and out using the scroll wheel, with the zoom level clamped for consistency. Furthermore, it features a subtle built-in screen shake effect to enhance the visual experience.</p>
