       <p>Star Raiders was a collaborative game development project I worked on with two other team members. I served as the lead art director and programmer, overseeing the technical architecture of the game's systems.<br><br>Star Raiders is a monochrome 2D shoot-'em-up where players can collect parts of the environment or enemies to use as both cover and weapons while navigating through space. The game features three main modes: Normal, Endless, and Duo/Versus, along with a separate hard mode and a boss fight. We spent two months developing Star Raiders before its completion.</p>

                <span>Game Loop:</span>
                <p>In the main game of Star Raiders, I developed several key systems, including: Enemy AI Behavior, Player Movement, the Grab Mechanic, the User Interface, a retro-style lives system, win-loss mechanics, and the scoring system.<br><br>Through this process, I learned to effectively utilize key programming concepts such as RNG (pseudo-randomly generated numbers), iteration, parent/child objects, object-oriented programming, and global variables.<br><br>If I were to remake Star Raiders, I would focus on reworking the enemy behavior and making the grabbing system more engaging and dynamic. One common suggestion I received was to allow grabbed enemies to shoot projectiles on the player's behalf, which I think would be a fun addition.</p>

                <span>Boss:</span>
                <p>The boss in Star Raiders showcases the enemy AI behavior logic I developed during the project. His programming is straightforward, primarily using cooldown counters and pseudo-randomly generated numbers. He has a chance to move up or down quickly as the player fires at him, creating the illusion that he’s dodging with reflexes.<br><br>If I were to redesign the boss, I would consider using a finite-state machine, as I didn't get to implement many of those in Star Raiders, and I think they would have worked well.<br><br>Additionally, the difficulty of the boss scales with his health points (HP). This was achieved by having the random object spawner monitor the boss's HP and trigger changes when it drops below a certain threshold.</p>

                <span>Endless:</span>
                <p>Endless mode uses some of the same logic as the boss fight, including a random object spawner and increasing difficulty. However, in Endless mode, the difficulty increases over time rather than through a health bar.<br><br>One key lesson I learned from developing Endless mode was about memory management. It became crucial to destroy objects that had moved offscreen during the endless runs; otherwise, they would remain in memory and eventually cause the computer to run out of resources.<br><br>If I were to redesign the Endless mode, I would like to add more variety to the objects that can spawn and potentially implement a component system to create a range of different objects with unique effects dynamically.</p>

        <h1>Known Issues:</h1>
        <p>| After game was imported to a newer version of GMS2, Duo Mode Broke.</p>
        <p>| If the cursor goes off the screen it will sink into the black space.</p>
        <p>| Messing around whilst on the enter name screen can mess up the leaderboard.</p>
        <p>| Entities spawn closer to the player than they should on endless mode.</p>
